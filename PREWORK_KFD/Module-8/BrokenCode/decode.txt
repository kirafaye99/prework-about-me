There were a couple issues in the broken code.
One of the first things I noticed when I opened the page in the browser is that there was no photo. This happed because there was no <> around img.
There were also some problems in the js file. The click to grow or shrink boxes weren't working because the "click" wasn't in quotes.
None of the js elements were working at first because the js file was not linked correctly.
There was also a problem with the list because there was no <li> </li> around each list element.
These are only the ones I can remember off the top of my head after completing the activity, but I'm sure there were other things I decoded, too.
